# This script opens a new database (named foo - you can change that if
# you like) and reads in the file that has all the subckt
# descriptions. This file defaults to dut.scs and the name is set in
# the elccfg file. It then analyzes all the subckts in that file to
# discover what gates they are so ELC can generate test vectors for
# step2.
