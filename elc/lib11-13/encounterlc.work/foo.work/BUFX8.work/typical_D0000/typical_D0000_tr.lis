Usage:

      |        -usage
        
    -batch <file.mdl>         The pathname or filename of the SpectreMDL file
                              that generated the data to be postprocessed.
                              If this argument is omitted, it
                              will default to a filename consisting of the
                              basename of the design file, with an extension
                              of .mdl appended. This file must exist in the
                              current directory. Both -design and -batch
                              arguments must be supplied, if the basenames
                              are different.

    -design <file.scs>        The pathname or filename of the netlist that
                              generated the data to be postprocessed.  If this
                              argument is
                              omitted, a file with the basename of the batch
                              argument, with an extension of .scs or .ckt is
                              searched for in the current directory, and used
                              as the default.

    -measure <file.measure>   The default output filename is taken from the
                              basename of the design argument, and appended
                              with the .measure extension. This option creates
                              the output file with the specified name. If a
                              pathname is not specified, the output file is
                              created in the directory of the design argument.

    -prec '<format>'          Optional argument to specify the precision of
                              of the measured value output in the measurement
                              file.  Example:  '%.15g' will output the
                              measured values to 15 significant digits.

    -tab                      Optional argument to specify that the measure
                              file should be displayed in tabular format.

    -outdir <directory>       Optional argument to specify an alternate
                              output directory location for all raw data and
                              output files.  Should not be used with the -raw
                              Spectre option.

    -mt0                      Optional argument to produce mt0 format data
                              files as well as the default .measure file.

    -usage                    Display this help text.
