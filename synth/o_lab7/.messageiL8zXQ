.SH SYNOPSIS
Error found when processing LEF file '%s'. The subsequent file content is ignored. Refer to error messages above for details. Fix the errors, and restart '%s' again.

.SH DESCRIPTION
If you have LEF syntax errors, you can look at the LEF manual to find the 
correct syntax. It can be accessed from the Encounter Help->Help Library... 
menu.  Look under the Languages section for the latest LEF/DEF Language 
Reference Manual.

If there are semantic errors, check if you have the correct LEF technology file 
(the first file listed in the init_lef_file variable), or that you are not 
mistakenly including a LEF file with macros from some other technology node. 
You can also look at the manual for more information about specific statements.
